		    I am currently an MS student in Northeastern's bioinformatics program, graduating May 2019. I have been working in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/katielotterhos/home">Lotterhos Lab</a> at Northeastern since February 2018. I started as an unpaid volunteer and after proving I was an efficient and effective worker I was offered a position as a paid co-op. Over the past year in the Lotterhos Lab I have worked on a variety of bioinformatics projects and learned a lot about population genetics (although I still have a lot to learn!). You can see a few of my projects highlighted below, including an effective migration analysis of eastern oyster genome data, a set of scripts used in conjunction with CellProfiler to analyze oyster larvae images, and a machine learning classifier that examines a wide variety of population genetics summary statistics to find SNPs under selection or unusual rates of recombination more accurately than any of them can alone. You can also see more projects than the three I highlighted here by going to my <a href="https://github.com/KSFreeman">github profile.</a>
                    </p>

			Before beginning my degree in bioinformatics, I attended Northeastern as an undergraduate student on a National Merit Scholarship. During that time, I worked as an environmental science teacher at an urban farm in Cape Town and as a quality assurance technician at the Sam Adams brewery before I decided that bioinformatics was the career for me. I graduated in 2017 with a BS in Biology.

                        <p> 
			<a href="https://github.com/dipetkov/eems/blob/master/Documentation/EEMS-doc.pdf">EEMS</a> is a program that estimates effective migration rate among populations to identify areas of unusually high or low gene flow. For this project, I plotted EEMS results from an analysis done on sequencing data from eastern oysters that was collected as part of the <a href="https://github.com/jpuritz/OysterGenomeProject">Eastern Oyster Genome Project</a>. Note that this EEMS analysis is not included in the current version of the Eastern Oyster Genome repository because it was done with an earlier version of the sequencing data that had some irregularities. I still think it is a nice project to include here becausethe README includes visually interesting plots and the notes that I included in the repository give a good glimpse into how I think through a problem.

                        <p>
                            This is an in-progress project that I have been working on mostly independently as an extension of the Test The Tests project. Working based on recent publications in the field, I trained a random forest classifier on existing simulation data and compared its accuracy to the existing genome scans we were testing. A nice overview of what I found is in the README. I am currently working on writing new simulations to more thoroughly test the method. The project was done in Jupyter notebooks using numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

                        <h3>Parallelization of CellProfiler</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://cellprofiler.org/">CellProfiler</a> is a tool developed by the Broad Institute to make it easy for biologists to apply computer vision algorithms to their microscopy data. As part of a project on ocean acdification, our lab generated 1000 images of oyster larvae at different timepoints. The CellProfiler GUI is easy to use but running it with 1000 images is too computationally costly on our equipment. To solve this issue I created a pipeline in bash that runs CellPofiler from the command line on a set of images in parallel so that we could do our analysis on our cluster. This is some of the more extensive bash scripting that I have done and I am particularly proud of the thorough input checking I implemented.
